			<h4>What is WebDAV?</h4>

			<p>WebDAV means <strong>Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning.</strong></p>
			<p>When you connect to the internet, HTTP lets you view webpages and interact with them by following hyperlinks. If pages are shared documents or on a wiki, you can edit them. Other pages are read-only for most users. HTTP canâ€™t edit those, which is where WebDAV comes in.</p>
			<p>WebDAV is a extension to HTTP that lets clients edit remote content on the web. In essence, it enables a web server to act as a file server, allowing authors to collaborate on web content.</p>
			<p>It also provides the ability to create a file or folder, edit a file in place, copy or move or delete a file, etc. It normally uses port 80 for unencrypted access and port 443(HTTPS) for secure access.</p>
			<p>We might encounter WebDAV in the <strong>Apache HTTP Server, Microsoft IIS, Box.com, WordPress, Drupal, Microsoft Sharepoint, Subversion, GIT, Windows Explorer, macOS Finder, Microsoft Office, Apple iWork, Adobe Photoshop</strong>, and many other places.</p>

			<h4>History of WebDAV</h4>

			<p> WebDAV began in 1996 when Jim Whitehead, a PhD graduate from UC Irvine, worked with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to host two meetings to discuss the problem of distributed authoring on the World Wide Web with interested people. Tim Berners-Lee's original vision of the Web involved a medium for both reading and writing. In fact, Berners-Lee's first web browser, called WorldWideWeb, could both view and edit web pages; but, as the Web grew, it became a read-only medium for most users. Whitehead and other like-minded people wanted to transcend that limitation.</p>
			<p>At the beginning of the protocol, it became clear that handling both distributed authoring and versioning together would involve too much work and that the tasks would have to be separated. The WebDAV group focused on distributed authoring, and left versioning for the future. </p>
			<p>After the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) accepted an incremental update to RFC 2518, the WebDAV working group concluded its work, in March 2007.</p>
